# Get Minimalist Game Framework to Run on a Mac

Hi! To get the minimalist game framework running on a Mac!!

Before you start, you'll want to have Visual Studio installed alongside C#. This might be annoying, but Visual Studio should prompt you to install C#/DotNet when you get started.

Once you have this working, download this repository onto your computer. Then, open it up in terminal â€“ you can do this through unzipping the folder in Finder, and then dragging it into the Terminal app icon (on your Dock).

Then, run "sudo su", this will give the "setup.sh" file permission to run. Then, run "sh setup.sh". This will install the necessary dependencies for the game to run.

If you have any issues with this, shoot me an email at pranavnt at outlook dot com
